## My process

Just the basics: got the needed html elements and added the proper css content.
- first i made a div for the card.
got all the required contents in it in suitable divs (the additional text, headers, date, author.)
- added the proper css (struggled with centering the card but got right at the end.)
- added the hover effect on the blog title. (you can try it!!)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flex

### What I learned

-learned how to center a div(for the 10th time XD)
  a reminder: flex --> align-items: center + justify-items: center + set height of container --> centered div.
